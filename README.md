# My Own Todo App

## TODO

- [ ] Burger menu
    - [ ] Settings (I need to think about it)
    - [ ] Export/Import data (CSV or maybe something else like JSON or maybe a format supported by other apps -> Todoist
      uses a CSV format)
- [ ] Save project in GitHub!
    - [ ] See if it's possible to use GHA freely -> 500MB (enough I guess?) / 2000 minutes per month so around 1h per
      day every day, should be enough for now
- [ ] Deploy on my NAS
    - [ ] Generate backup via a cron task of the nitrite db and store it somewhere safe (google drive?)
- [ ] Task items
    - [ ] Display comments
    - [ ] Add/edit/delete comments
- [ ] Tasks list
    - [ ] Rethink the UX
    - [ ] Hide task in the future (like 7+ days) by default
- [ ] Auto reminder
    - [ ] Notifications? Might work on mobile
    - [ ] Email? Not sure how to do that from my NAS
